##Welcome to Lite Write

Like most programmers, I'm most comfortable writing in my text editor of choice. I do a fair amount of writing though, and over time I've grown frustrated with word processors. I turned to LaTeX because it gave me more control over formatting and produced beautiful looking documents. While awesome for equations and many other things, LaTeX can be cumbersome and distract from what you're actually writing.

Lite Write is my approach to word processing, and what I use in place of a MS word, openoffice, or LaTeX. It is an admittedly simple setup (basically a Makefile and some bits of CSS and HTML), but allows you to:

- Write everything in markdown!
- Produce a PDF of your document
- Produce an HTML version anyone can view online
- Super simple, so its easily to expanded / extended
